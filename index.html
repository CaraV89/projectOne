            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a senior here at Eastern and I am a Visual Communication and Design major. I am also trying to get my minor in Spanish. You can usually find me going on random adventures and trying new food, or binge watching a tv show on netflix for the fourth time. I tend to be a well rounded person who loves to laugh and have a good time.</p>
            
                <p>My goals other than to obviously graduate this coming Spring is to work with non-profit organizations, start-up businesses and/or small businesses. I want to be able to help others bring their vision to life for their organization or business. I feel that it would be very rewarding to help in the process of launching someone's passion through visual communicaiton.</p>

                <p>This book is one of my favorites because of the era, langauge and the bitter-sweet realtionship between different "classes" of women. The book literally makes you feel all kidns of emotions, including sympathy, </p>
