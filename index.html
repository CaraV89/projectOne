            <h2 class="About Me">About Me</h2>

                <p>I am currently a senior here at Eastern Washington University and I am a Visual Communication and Design major. I am also hoping to get my minor in Spanish. You can usually find me going on random adventures and trying new food, or binge watching a tv show on netflix for the fourth time. I tend to be a well rounded person who loves to laugh and have a good time.</p>
            
                <p>My goals other than to obviously graduate this coming Spring is to work with non-profit organizations, start-up businesses and/or small businesses. I want to be able to help others bring their vision to life for their organization or business. I feel that it would be very rewarding to help in the process of launching someone's passion through visual communicaiton.</p>
            
            <h2 class="book"> Favorite Book </h2>
           
                <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Help-Kathryn-Stockett/dp/0425232204/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475717241&sr=8-1&keywords=the+help+book></a> <img class="Book" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Thehelpbookcover.jpg/220px-Thehelpbookcover.jpg">
                
                <p>It's a book about African-American maids in Jackson, Mississippi during the early 1960s. This book is one of my favorites because of the era, langauge and the bitter-sweet realtionship between different "classes" of women. The book makes you feel every emotion known to man. I love the indiviuality of each character and the telling of their struggles and victories during this tough time.</p>

                <p>Egg drop soup may not be a meal by itself, but it is definitely a dish that I can eat any day of the year. It's a simple recipe, but that flavor is where it's at!</p>
