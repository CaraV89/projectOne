<h1> Caroline R. Villasenor</h1>
            
            <p>I am a Visual Communication and Design major, hoping to graduate in the Spring of 2017! I love to go on new adventures and try new foods.</p>

            <p>Post-graduation I hope to use my degree and work with non-profit organizations and/or start-up businesses. I think it would be quite rewarding to help capture the vision of business owners and/or non-profit leaders by creating logos, graphics and market their ideas.</p>
